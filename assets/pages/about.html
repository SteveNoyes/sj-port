        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm Shakirah Johnson, a passionate QA Specialist with a deep love for finding patterns, refining processes, and making products the best they can be.</p>
        <p>I believe that good quality assurance is about more than just testing—it's about collaboration, empathy, and communication. Over the past decade, I’ve built a career rooted in the medical industry, with experience spanning data entry, pharmaceutical support, and quality assurance. I began my journey in healthcare through data entry roles, where I developed a strong foundation in accuracy, attention to detail, and working with sensitive patient information. That experience naturally led me into pharmacy, where I worked as a pharmaceutical technician. In that role, I gained firsthand knowledge of medication handling, insurance processes, and the importance of precision in every step of patient care.</p>
        <p>For the past two years, I’ve transitioned into Quality Assurance, where I’ve focused on ensuring the accuracy and usability of both medical and pharmacy data. I’ve combined my knowledge of healthcare workflows with strong technical and analytical skills to validate data integrity and ensure that digital templates display information correctly. My background has helped me understand not just the systems behind the data, but the real-world impact of getting it right.</p>
        <p>Working in healthcare has taught me that every detail matters, and I bring that mindset into every QA project I take on.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, photography, and exploring new cafes in the city.</p>
